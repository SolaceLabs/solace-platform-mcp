## Overview

This repository contains Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for various Solace products. 
These servers enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to securely access, monitor, and interact with Solace event brokers and other Solace products.


## Purpose

The MCP servers in this repository provide standardized interfaces for AI systems to:
- Monitor Solace PubSub+ event brokers in real-time
- Retrieve metrics and operational data from Solace products
- Execute management operations through natural language instructions
- Access event mesh topology and configuration information
- Analyze message flow patterns and performance metrics
